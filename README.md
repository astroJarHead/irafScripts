IRAF cl scripts

A container for scripts that I use for processing astronomical images in IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility). See the repository:

https://github.com/iraf-community

for more information on IRAF. 

## Supporting shell scripts

A few shell scripts used with these IRAF cl scripts are included for completeness 
and ease of archiving and finding these things. I find it easier to put all these into 
one repository.
